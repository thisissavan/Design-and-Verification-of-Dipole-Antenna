# Design-and-Verification-of-Dipole-Antenna

- Generated dipole antenna and rectangular plots as well as the polar plots using GNEC software.
- Verified the plots using direct equation plotting in MATLAB.

Observations:

- As the length of the dipole antenna increases beyond the wavelength, the number of side lobes begins to increase.
- At the same time the beam becomes narrower as the length increases.
